PS2 Keyboard/Mouse Controller
=============================

 This unit provides supporting functions and definitions for PS/2 keyboard and mouse
 controller drivers.

 The constants defined here are not a complete set but represent the most commonly
 used PS/2 functions and operations. Of most importance is the mouse packet and the
 keyboard scancode structures which provide support for receiving the actual data
 from a keyboard or a mouse.

 This unit also includes the PS/2 scancode sets which define the actual values that
 are received in response to each key press and release. Currently only scancode set
 2 is defined as in many instances that is considered the standard scancode set and
 some devices simply do not support scancode set 1 or 3.
